# Gum Spinner Integration

## What Was Added

Real `gum spin` integration for long-running operations.

### Functions

**`ui.SpinCommand(title, name, args...)`**
- Runs external command with gum spinner
- Example: `rsync`, `ssh`, etc.
- Shows spinner while command executes

**`ui.SpinFunc(title, shellCmd)`**
- Runs shell command string with spinner
- For complex shell scripts

**`ui.Success/Error/Info(msg)`**
- Styled output using gum
- Graceful fallback if gum not installed

## Example Output

### With Gum:
```
â ™ Syncing to homelab:~/distributed
Transfer starting...
[rsync progress]
âœ“ Sync complete
```

### Without Gum:
```
â†’ Syncing to homelab:~/distributed...
[rsync progress]
âœ“ Sync complete
```

## Commands Using Spinners

- `d sync` - Shows spinner during rsync
- `d run` - Styled output for execution
- `d load` - Clean progress messages
- `d status` - Status checking

## Installation

Gum is optional but recommended:
```bash
brew install gum
```

CLI works fine without it, just less fancy.

## Implementation

- Spinner only for external commands (rsync, ssh)
- Go functions use simple styled output
- No complex async logic
- Falls back gracefully
